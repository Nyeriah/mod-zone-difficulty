# Zone Difficulty Module

[English](README.md) | [Espa√±ol](README_ES.md)


## What is the purpose of this module?
This module provides a way to nerf or debuff players in order to increase the difficulty of certain dungeons or balance battlegrounds/duels.

## How to use this module?
This module reads data from the `zone_difficulty_info` and `zone_difficulty_spelloverrides` table.
`_info` serves to apply nerfs/debuffs per map and per phase. For example, you can nerf healing
by 90% and absorb-effects by 80% while increasing the melee damage players suffer by 50% and reducing the
spell damage players suffer by 30%. That is only inside the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj dungeon (MapId 531)
for all phases (0 = Skip PhaseMask check, 6 = phases 2 and 4) with the following query:

```sql
INSERT INTO `zone_difficulty_info` (`MapId`, `PhaseMask`, `HealingNerfValue`, `AbsorbNerfValue`, `MeleeDmgBuffValue`, `SpellDmgBuffValue`, `Enabled`, `Comment`) VALUES
(531, 0, '0.10', '0.20', '1.50', '0.70', 1, 'AQ40 Healing 50% / Absorb 50% Nerf / 50% physical & 30% spell damage buff');
```

The heal-output will be multiplied by the value you input in `HealingNerfValue` as it follows:

```cpp
output = output * HealingNerfValue
```

Using `MapId` 2147483647 will be used for all targets in duels while they're in the zone hardcoded as `DUEL_AREA` (default 2402: Forbidding Sea, Wetlands).
PhaseMask must be 0 for Duels.

You can also prevent certain spells from being affected at all. See `zone_difficulty_spelloverrides.sql` for examples.

## Changing values

You can edit the `zone_difficulty_info_content.sql` file to apply changes. They will be applied by the autoupdater the next time you restart your server.
Alternatively, you may edit the `zone_difficulty_info` table in your `world` database and use the `reload config` command to reload the values.
